# Smith_CSCI2270_FinalProject
Final Project repo for CSCI 2270

My project will be analogous to a basic rpg game, similar to a very low-level final fantasy combat system. There will be different classes that the player can choose from and they will battle a series of monsters to level up and get strong, which will in turn make it easier to battle the monsters. There *may* also be some sort of shop system involved where the player can buy items that will allow them to have different stats and abilities.
The different pieces of data such as statistics, enemies slain, lists of all the enemies, classes, etc. will all be stored in the appropriate type of data structure for the data. I expect that there will be several linked lists, structs, and many arrays involved in the final implementation of the project.
